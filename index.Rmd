data <- data %>%
  mutate(wage = wage/100)

The topic of our study is the effect of education on wages. The first graph shows the relationship between peopleâ€™s knowledge of world work score (KWW) and their hourly wage. To specify this relationship, we introduced a control variable: educational background, which is correlated with both the score and the hourly wage. As we can see, the KWW score is generally positively associated with an hourly wage. And educational attainment also played a role, as people with only elementary school degrees earned lower hourly wages than those with higher degrees, despite equal KWW scores.  And the positive association between KWW score and hourly wage is linear for people with primary education or lower.

From the previous graph, we know that education plays a role in determining hourly wages. The chart below further examines how soon people with lower education levels can keep up with those with higher education. For instance, it will take approximately ten years for people with an elementary school degree or less to receive $5 per hour. On the contrary, people with a college degree and above generally get paid $5 from the very beginning.

The previous two graphs show the effect of education on wages. But do people with the same level of education necessarily have the same wages? To examine this question, we introduced a new variable to see the effect of race. The graph shows that whites have higher hourly wages than blacks even if they have the same number of years of education. This suggests that there may be systematic racial differences in the labor market beyond education levels.

People living near universities may have more opportunities and connections to get into highly paid companies. They could also already be wealthy people, for areas around universities are typically expensive. The graph below shows that there's more percentage of people who live near the 4-year college at the hourly wage of $5 and above, vice versa.
\
\
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat_nearc4 <- as.factor(ifelse(data$nearc4 == 1, 'Live near 4-year college', 'Live far from 4-year college'))
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=wage, fill=cat_nearc4, color=cat_nearc4)) +
  geom_density(position="identity", alpha=0.5) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 5),col='black',size = 0.5, linetype = 2) +
